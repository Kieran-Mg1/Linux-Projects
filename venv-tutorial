## "$" denotes commands in the bash terminal
# I like to create a new directory to keep all the files I may need for a project
$mkdir Bayes

# Change to this directory
$ cd Bayes

## Depending on what you have installed, you can download the packages needed for a virtual environment
# For python 3:
$ pip3 install virtualenv

# Or, if using miniconda/anaconda
$ conda install virtual env

# This can (and did for me) throw an error message as the installation is to the user, so you'll need to add
the users PATH
$ export PATH=$:/home/ubuntu/.local/bin

# Note that unless you change the ~./ profile
$ source ~./profile
#or
$ source ~./bashrc
# Note however this is often considered a security flaw as the bash terminal will look in the current directory for executables, for example if you cd into a directory and run ls, a malicious programme called ls would run instead

# Installing the requests package for a venv is also a good idea, to keep track of what packages are currently loaded for the project
$ pipenv install requests

# Create a virtual environment
$ virtualenv bayes

# Run venv
$ source bayes/venv/bin/activate

# To halt
$ deactivate
